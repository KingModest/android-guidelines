# 1. Project sttructure guidelines

## 1.1 Project structure

New projects should follow the Android Gradle project structure that is defined on the [Android Gradle plugin user guide](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide#TOC-Project-Structure). The [ribot Boilerplate](https://github.com/ribot/android-boilerplate) project is a good reference to start from.

## 1.2 File naming

### 1.2.1 Class files
Class names are written in [UpperCamelCase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase).

For classes that extend an Android component, the name of the class should start with the name of the component; for example: `ActivitySignIn`, `FragmentSignIn`, `ServiceImageUploader`, `DialogChangePassword`.

### 1.2.2 Resources files

Resources file names are written in __lowercase_underscore__.

## 1.3 Package naming
Packages names shall be only with lowercase
